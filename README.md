This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VBScript related to the `IsEmpty` function and its interaction with empty strings. The function `f` intends to add two numbers, defaulting to 0 if either input is empty.  While this seems to work for empty strings, the behavior is non-intuitive as `IsEmpty` doesn't reliably detect empty strings in all scenarios, leading to possible runtime errors or unexpected results. The solution presents a more robust approach using a different method for handling potentially empty inputs.
